-----------
The [`Falkor/dotfiles`](https://github.com/Falkor/dotfiles) repository holds my configuration files for `bash`, `zsh`, `git`, `vim` etc. so as to set up a system the way I like it.

This is the main page of the documentation for this repository, which is hosted and managed by [Read the Docs](http://falkor-dotfiles.readthedocs.org/en/latest/).
It proposes to detail the following elements:

* An [Overview](overview.md) of the project is proposed, with installation notes.
* How to [test these dotfiles with Vagrant](vagrant.md)
* How to [contribute](contributing/index.md) to these development. In particular, we detail:
     - the [directory tree structure](contributing/layout.md)
	 - the steps to follow to [setup this repository](contributing/setup.md)
	 - information as regard the [semantic versioning](contributing/versioning.md) of this Puppet module.
     - Apart form the directory layout, we will cover various configuration aspects (mainly [git-flow](https://github.com/nvie/gitflow))
* Details on the [Read the Docs](http://falkor-dotfiles.readthedocs.org/en/latest/) management.
