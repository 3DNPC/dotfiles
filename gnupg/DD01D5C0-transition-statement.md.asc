I am transitioning my GPG keys from an old 1024-bit DSA key (`0xA403AC45DD01D5C0`)
to a new 4096-bit RSA key (`0x5D08BCDD4F156AD7`).
The old key will continue to be valid for a short period of time after the
posting of this message, but future signatures will be created from the new key
and I prefer all new correspondance to be encrypted with the new key.

This transition document is signed with both keys to certify the transition.

The **old** key was:

    pub   1024D/0xA403AC45DD01D5C0 2006-05-19
          Key fingerprint = E273 5952 5AB9 A7FA D786  2C15 A403 AC45 DD01 D5C0

The **new** key is:

    pub   4096R/0x5D08BCDD4F156AD7 2017-03-01
          Key fingerprint = 1A53 FD6E 09A4 4DBA 7A9F  D72B 5D08 BCDD 4F15 6AD7

Note that the signing of this message may have been done by a **SUBKEY** of the
above key.

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
To fetch the new key from a public key server, you can use the following:

      gpg --keyserver pgp.mit.edu --recv-key 5D08BCDD4F156AD7


* _If you already know my old key_, you can verify that the new key has been
  signed by the old one using:

         gpg --check-sigs  5D08BCDD4F156AD7

* _If you donâ€™t know (yet) my old key_, or you want to be extra careful, you can
  check the fingerprint against the one above:

         gpg --fingerprint 5D08BCDD4F156AD7

You can verify the signatures on this message by downloading the plain
text file as linked and running:

     gpg --verify <filename>

Finally, if you are satisfied that you have the right key, that the UIDs match
what you expect, and you are certain of my identity, I would appreciate it if
you would sign my new key:

     gpg --sign-key 5D08BCDD4F156AD7
     gpg --keyserver pgp.mit.edu --send-key 5D08BCDD4F156AD7
