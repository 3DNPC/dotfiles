# Sebastien Varrette aka Falkor's dotfiles (zsh, bash, vim, screen etc.)

These are my configuration files for `bash`, `zsh`, `git`, `vim` etc. so as to set up a system the way I like it. 
Here is a Screenshot

__Warning:__ Use these dotfiles at your own risk!

In the sequel, when providing a command, `$>` denotes a prompt and is not part of the commands.

## Pre-requisites

You should install the following elements to use the full functionality of
these config files:

* bash
* bash-completions
* zsh
* screen
* git
* subversion
* vim

## Installation

### Using Git and the embedded Makefile

This repository is hosted on [Github](https://github.com/Falkor/dotfiles).

* To clone this repository into `~/.dotfiles.falkor.d/`, proceed as follows

        $> git clone https://github.com/Falkor/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles.falkor.d

**`/!\ IMPORTANT`**: Once cloned, initiate your local copy of the repository by running:

	    $> cd ~/.dotfiles.falkor.d
	    $> make setup

This will initiate the [Git submodules of this repository](.gitmodules) and setup the [git flow](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/gitflow-workflow) layout for this repository.

Later on, you can upgrade the [Git submodules](.gitmodules) to the latest version by running:

          $> make update


## Contributing / Repository Setup for developers

1. [Fork](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) it.
2. To clone your forked copy of this repository, proceed as follows (adapt accordingly):

        $> mkdir -p ~/git/github.com/<YOUR_LOGIN>
        $> cd ~/git/github.com/<YOUR_LOGIN>
        $> git clone https://github.com/<YOUR_LOGIN>/dotfiles.git

3. **`/!\ IMPORTANT`**: Once cloned, initiate your local copy of the repository ([Git-flow](https://github.com/nvie/gitflow), Git [submodules](.gitmodules) etc.) by running:

        $> cd dotfiles
		$> make setup

4. Create your own feature branch

          $> git checkout -b my-new-feature

5. Commit your changes (`git commit -am 'Added some feature'`)
6. Push to the branch (`git push origin my-new-feature`)
7. Create a new [Pull Request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/) to submit your changes to me.




Later on, you can upgrade the [Git submodules](.gitmodules) to the latest version by running:

    $> make upgrade

## Issues / Feature request

You can submit bug / issues / feature request using the [`Falkor/dotfiles` Project Tracker](https://github.com/Falkor/dotfiles/issues)

## Advanced Topics

### Git

This repository make use of [Git](http://git-scm.com/) such that you should have it installed on your working machine:

       $> apt-get install git-core # On Debian-like systems
       $> yum install git          # On CentOS-like systems
       $> brew install git         # On Mac OS, using [Homebrew](http://mxcl.github.com/homebrew/)
       $> port install git         # On Mac OS, using MacPort

Consider these resources to become more familiar (if not yet) with Git:

* [Simple Git Guide](http://rogerdudler.github.io/git-guide/)
* [Git book](http://book.git-scm.com/index.html)
* [Github:help](http://help.github.com/mac-set-up-git/)
* [Git reference](http://gitref.org/)

At least, you shall configure the following variables

       $> git config --global user.name "Your Name Comes Here"
       $> git config --global user.email you@yourdomain.example.com
       # configure colors
       $> git config --global color.diff auto
       $> git config --global color.status auto
       $> git config --global color.branch auto

Note that you can create git command aliases in `~/.gitconfig` as follows:

       [alias]
           up = pull origin
           pu = push origin
           st = status
           df = diff
           ci = commit -s
           br = branch
           w  = whatchanged --abbrev-commit
           ls = ls-files
           gr = log --graph --oneline --decorate
           amend = commit --amend

Consider my personal [`.gitconfig`](https://github.com/Falkor/dotfiles/blob/master/git/.gitconfig) as an example -- if you decide to use it, simply copy it in your home directory and adapt the `[user]` section.

### [Git-flow](https://github.com/nvie/gitflow)

The Git branching model for this repository follows the guidelines of
[gitflow](http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/).
In particular, the central repository holds two main branches with an infinite lifetime:

* `production`: the *production-ready* branch
* `master`: the main branch where the latest developments interviene. This is the *default* branch you get when you clone the repository.

Thus you are more than encouraged to install the [git-flow](https://github.com/nvie/gitflow) extensions following the [installation procedures](https://github.com/nvie/gitflow/wiki/Installation) to take full advantage of the proposed operations. The associated [bash completion](https://github.com/bobthecow/git-flow-completion) might interest you also.

### Releasing mechanism

The operation consisting of releasing a new version of this repository is automated by a set of tasks within the root `Makefile`.

In this context, a version number have the following format:

      <major>.<minor>.<patch>[-b<build>]

where:

* `< major >` corresponds to the major version number
* `< minor >` corresponds to the minor version number
* `< patch >` corresponds to the patching version number
* (eventually) `< build >` states the build number _i.e._ the total number of commits within the `master` branch.

Example: \`1.0.0-b28\`

The current version number is stored in the root file `VERSION`. __/!\ NEVER MAKE ANY MANUAL CHANGES TO THIS FILE__

For more information on the version, run:

     $> make versioninfo

If a new version number such be bumped, you simply have to run:

      $> make start_bump_{major,minor,patch}

This will start the release process for you using `git-flow`.
Once you have finished to commit your last changes, make the release effective by running:

      $> make release

It will finish the release using `git-flow`, create the appropriate tag in the `production` branch and merge all things the way they should be.
