# Sebastien Varrette aka Falkor's dotfiles

These are my configuration files for `bash`, `zsh`, `git`, `vim` etc. so as to set up a system the way I like it.
For instance, here is a screenshot of my terminal illustrating its behaviour on classical contexts commonly met on a daily usage of interactions with git repositories etc.

![](screenshots/screenshot_falkor_iterm.png)

__Warning:__ Use these dotfiles at your own risk!

In the sequel, when providing a command, `$>` denotes a prompt and is not part of the commands.

## Pre-requisites

You should install the following elements to use the full functionality of
these config files:

* bash
* bash-completions
* zsh
* zsh-completions
* screen
* git
* subversion
* vim
* ssh

## Installation

### Using Git and the embedded Makefile

This repository is hosted on [Github](https://github.com/Falkor/dotfiles). You can clone the repository wherever you want.
Personally, I like to keep it in `~/git/github.com/Falkor/dotfiles`, with `~/.dotfiles.falkor.d` as a symlink.
Othoerwise, to clone this repository directly into `~/.dotfiles.falkor.d/`, proceed as follows

        $> git clone https://github.com/Falkor/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles.falkor.d

**`/!\ IMPORTANT`**: Once cloned, initiate your local copy of the repository by running:

	    $> cd ~/.dotfiles.falkor.d
	    $> make setup

This will initiate the [Git submodules of this repository](.gitmodules) and setup the [git flow](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/gitflow-workflow) layout for this repository.

Now to install all my dotfiles, run:

        $> make install

### Git-free install

TODO (with curl over `install.sh`)

## Updating / Upgrading

Upgrading is normally as simple as:

     $> make -C ~/.dotfiles.falkor.d update

OR, if you prefer a more atomic approach:

     $> cd ~/.dotfiles.falkor.d
     $> git pull
     $> make update

Note that if you wish to upgrade the [Git submodules](.gitmodules) to the latest version, you should run:

     $> make update
