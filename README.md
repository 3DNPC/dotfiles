# Sebastien Varrette aka Falkor's dotfiles

These are my configuration files for `bash`, `zsh`, `git`, `vim` etc. so as to set up a system the way I like it.
For instance, here is a screenshot of my terminal illustrating its behaviour on classical contexts commonly met on a daily usage of interactions with git repositories etc.

![](docs/screenshots/screenshot_falkor_iterm.png)

__Warning:__ Use these dotfiles at your own risk!

In the sequel, when providing a command, `$>` denotes a prompt and is not part of the commands.

## Pre-requisites

You should install the following elements to use the full functionality of
these config files:

* bash
* bash-completions
* zsh
* zsh-completions
* screen
* git
* subversion
* vim
* ssh

## Installation

### Using Git and the embedded Makefile

This repository is hosted on [Github](https://github.com/Falkor/dotfiles). You can clone the repository wherever you want.
Personally, I like to keep it in `~/git/github.com/Falkor/dotfiles`, with `~/.dotfiles.falkor.d` as a symlink.
Othoerwise, to clone this repository directly into `~/.dotfiles.falkor.d/`, proceed as follows

        $> git clone https://github.com/Falkor/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles.falkor.d

**`/!\ IMPORTANT`**: Once cloned, initiate your local copy of the repository by running:

	    $> cd ~/.dotfiles.falkor.d
	    $> make setup

This will initiate the [Git submodules of this repository](.gitmodules) and setup the [git flow](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/gitflow-workflow) layout for this repository.

Now to install all my dotfiles, run:

        $> make install

### Git-free install



## Updating / Upgrading

Upgrading is normally as simple as:

     $> cd ~/.dotfiles.falkor.d
     $> git pull
     $> make update

Note that if you wish to upgrade the [Git submodules](.gitmodules) to the latest version, you should run:

     $> make update

## What's included and how to customize?

## Issues / Feature request

You can submit bug / issues / feature request using the [`Falkor/dotfiles` Project Tracker](https://github.com/Falkor/dotfiles/issues)

## Developments / Contributing to the code

If you want to contribute to the code, you shall be aware of the way this repository is organized and developed.
These elements are detailed on [`docs/contributing/`](contributing/index.md).

You are more than welcome to contribute to its development by [sending a pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests).



1. [Fork](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) it.
2. To clone your forked copy of this repository, proceed as follows (adapt accordingly):

        $> mkdir -p ~/git/github.com/<YOUR_LOGIN>
        $> cd ~/git/github.com/<YOUR_LOGIN>
        $> git clone https://github.com/<YOUR_LOGIN>/dotfiles.git

3. **`/!\ IMPORTANT`**: Once cloned, initiate your local copy of the repository ([Git-flow](https://github.com/nvie/gitflow), Git [submodules](.gitmodules) etc.) by running:

        $> cd dotfiles
		$> make setup

4. Create your own feature branch

          $> git checkout -b my-new-feature

5. Commit your changes (`git commit -am 'Added some feature'`)
6. Push to the branch (`git push origin my-new-feature`)
7. Create a new [Pull Request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/) to submit your changes to me.


Later on, you can upgrade the [Git submodules](.gitmodules) to the latest version by running:

    $> make upgrade


## Advanced Topics

### [Git-flow](https://github.com/nvie/gitflow)

The Git branching model for this repository follows the guidelines of
[gitflow](http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/).
In particular, the central repository holds two main branches with an infinite lifetime:

* `production`: the *production-ready* branch
* `master`: the main branch where the latest developments interviene. This is the *default* branch you get when you clone the repository.

Thus you are more than encouraged to install the [git-flow](https://github.com/nvie/gitflow) extensions following the [installation procedures](https://github.com/nvie/gitflow/wiki/Installation) to take full advantage of the proposed operations. The associated [bash completion](https://github.com/bobthecow/git-flow-completion) might interest you also.

## Resources

You can find of course many other resources in terms dotfiles repositories.
I suggest you to take a look at the following places I inspired:

* [Your unofficial guide to dotfiles on GitHub](https://dotfiles.github.io/)
* My friend [H.Cartiaux's dotfiles](https://github.com/hcartiaux/dotfiles)
* [Holman's does dotfiles](https://github.com/holman/dotfiles), for his idea of bundling the [homebrew](http://brew.sh) configuration
* [Mathiasâ€™s dotfiles](https://github.com/mathiasbynens/dotfiles),  for featuring `~/.osx` _i.e._ sensible hacker defaults for OS X;
* [Awesome dotfiles](https://github.com/webpro/awesome-dotfiles), a curated list of dotfiles resources. Inspired by the [awesome](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome) list thing.
